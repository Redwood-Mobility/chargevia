        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>ChargeVia is what EV charging should have been from the start. Fast chargers, a real convenience store, driver's lounge, clean restrooms - the whole gas station experience, minus the gas. Pull in, charge up, grab a coffee, use a bathroom that won't haunt your dreams, and get back on the road.</p>

        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Most charging networks stick chargers in dark parking lots or garages and call it a day. We actually thought about the human driving the car. We offer multiple fast chargers (no lines), a real store (snacks!), a lounge (Wi-Fi!), and covered bays (dry!).</p>

          <span>What vehicles can charge here?</span>

        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>If it has a plug, we probably charge it. ChargeVia stations feature both CCS (Combined Charging System) and NACS (Tesla-style) connectors. Whether you drive a Ford, Tesla, Hyundai, Rivian, or something else, we've got you covered.</p>

          <span>How fast is the charging?</span>

        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Fast. We use 150-350kW DC fast chargers. In plain English: most EVs can add 100+ miles of range in about 15-20 minutes. Just enough time for a pit stop.</p>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p><strong>Option 1 (Best):</strong> Join <a href="/beta/membership.html">Pathfinder Rewards</a>. Plug in, and the car talks to the charger to handle payment automatically.</p>
          <p><strong>Option 2:</strong> Credit/Debit card. Tap or insert at the machine. No app required.</p>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>It's our loyalty network. It works at ChargeVia and our partner networks. You get flat-rate pricing (no weird surge pricing), earn credits back on every charge, and access to the seamless "Plug & Charge" experience. <a href="/beta/membership.html">Learn more here.</a></p>

        <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
          <span>What's the difference between CCS and NACS?</span>
          <span class="faq-question-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p><strong>CCS (Combined Charging System)</strong> has been the standard for most non-Tesla EVs in North America. It's a larger connector that combines AC and DC charging.</p>
          <p><strong>NACS (North American Charging Standard)</strong> is Tesla's connector design, now being adopted by most major automakers. It's smaller and more ergonomic.</p>
          <p>Don't worry about which one you need - ChargeVia stations have both, and we'll have adapters available if you need them.</p>

          <span>Do you buy old gas stations?</span>

        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Yes! We love giving old stations new life. If you have a site you think would work, <a href="/beta/partners.html">let us know</a>.</p>

          <span>Can I reserve a charger?</span>
          <span class="faq-question-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Not yet, but it's coming! Pioneer-tier Pathfinder members will get early access to reserved charging when we launch the feature. For now, our stations are designed with enough chargers that wait times should be minimal.</p>

        <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
          <span>What if a charger isn't working?</span>

        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>First, try another charger - we have plenty. If you run into issues, there's a help button on every charger that connects you to our support team. We also monitor charger health 24/7 and dispatch technicians quickly when something's off. Our goal is 99%+ uptime.</p>
