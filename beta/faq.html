        <h3>What is ChargeVia?</h3>
        <p>ChargeVia is what EV charging should have been from the start. Fast chargers, a real convenience store, driver's lounge, clean restrooms - the whole gas station experience, minus the gas. Pull in, charge up, grab a coffee, use a bathroom that won't haunt your dreams, and get back on the road.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How is ChargeVia different?</h3>
        <p>Most charging networks stick chargers in dark parking lots or garages and call it a day. We actually thought about the human driving the car. We offer multiple fast chargers (no lines), a real store (snacks!), a lounge (Wi-Fi!), and covered bays (dry!).</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What vehicles can charge here?</h3>
        <p>If it has a plug, we probably charge it. ChargeVia stations feature both CCS (Combined Charging System) and NACS (Tesla style) connectors. Whether you drive a Ford, Tesla, Hyundai, Rivian, or something else, we've got you covered.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How fast is the charging?</h3>
        <p>Fast. We use 150-350kW DC fast chargers. In plain English: most EVs can add 100+ miles of range in about 15-20 minutes. Just enough time for a pit stop.</p>

        <h3>How do I pay?</h3>
        <p><strong>Option 1 (Best):</strong> Join <a href="/beta/membership.html">Pathfinder Rewards</a>. Plug in, and the car talks to the charger to handle payment automatically.</p>
        <p><strong>Option 2:</strong> Credit/Debit card. Tap or insert at the machine. No app required.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What is Pathfinder Rewards?</h3>
        <p>It's our loyalty network. It works at ChargeVia and our partner networks. You get flat-rate pricing (no weird surge pricing), earn credits back on every charge, and access to the seamless "Plug & Charge" experience. <a href="/beta/membership.html">Learn more here.</a></p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do you buy old gas stations?</h3>
        <p>Yes! We love giving old stations new life. If you have a site you think would work, <a href="/beta/partners.html">let us know</a>.</p>
