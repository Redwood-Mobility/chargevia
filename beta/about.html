      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>To make EV charging as convenient as filling up at your favorite gas station. We believe the future of transportation shouldn't feel like a compromise - it should feel like an upgrade.</p>

        <h2>Gas Station Heritage</h2>
        <p>We're not trying to reinvent the wheel - just what powers it. The gas station format has worked for a century for a reason: it's convenient, quick, and provides what drivers need.</p>
        <p>We're taking that proven model and electrifying it. Sometimes that means building new stations from scratch. Often, it means taking an old, abandoned service station and breathing new life into it. We keep the canopy, the convenience store, and the community feel, but swap the pumps for high-speed electrons.</p>

      <h2>The Team</h2>
      <p>We're a group of EV drivers, retail experts, and infrastructure nerds who got tired of charging in dark corners of shopping mall parking lots. We knew there had to be a better way, so we built it.</p>
