        <button class="faq-question">
          <span>What is ChargeVia?</span>
          <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>ChargeVia is what EV charging should have been from the start. Fast chargers, a real convenience store, driver's lounge, clean restrooms - the whole gas station experience, minus the gas. Pull in, charge up, grab a coffee, use a bathroom that won't haunt your dreams, and get back on the road.</p>

          <span>How is ChargeVia different from other charging networks?</span>
          <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Most charging networks stick chargers in parking lots or garages and call it a day. We actually thought about what makes charging suck less: multiple fast chargers so you're not waiting in line, a real convenience store, a lounge to hang out in, clean restrooms, and covered bays so you don't get rained on. It's a pit stop, not a punishment.</p>

        <button class="faq-question">
          <span>Where are ChargeVia stations located?</span>
          <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>We're building stations in cities and suburbs where EV drivers actually are - along commute routes, near shopping and dining, and accessible from major highways. Some are converted gas stations, others are new builds - all follow the familiar gas station format.

      <!-- Convenience Store -->

        <button class="faq-question">
          <span>What's at the convenience store?</span>
          <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>The good stuff: coffee, snacks, drinks, travel essentials, clean restrooms, and a driver's lounge with seating and Wi-Fi. It's not an afterthought vending machine - it's half the reason ChargeVia exists. Charge your car, charge yourself.</p>

        <button class="faq-question">
          <span>Do I have to buy anything at the store to use the chargers?</span>
          <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Nope. Charge without buying a thing if you want. But once you smell the coffee, we're pretty confident you'll reconsider.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">
          <span>What vehicles can charge at ChargeVia?</span>
          <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>ChargeVia stations have CCS (Combined Charging System) connectors, which work with most electric vehicles including Tesla (with adapter), Rivian, Ford, Chevrolet, Hyundai, Kia, BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen, and others. If your EV has a CCS port, it'll work at ChargeVia.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">
          <span>How fast is ChargeVia charging?</span>
          <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>150-350kW DC fast charging. Translation: most EVs can add 100+ miles of range in about 15-20 minutes. Enough time for a bathroom break and a snack, not enough time to watch a movie.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">
          <span>How do I pay for charging?</span>
          <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Two ways: (1) Plug-and-go - register your vehicle once with <a href="https://pathfinderrewards.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pathfinder Rewards</a>, then just plug in and charging starts and bills automatically. No cards, no apps, no QR codes. (2) Credit/debit card - tap or insert any major card at the charger. No account required for credit card payments.</p>

        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Pricing varies by location but is always flat-rate - you pay the same per kWh regardless of time of day. <a href="https://pathfinderrewards.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pathfinder Rewards</a> members get the best rates plus credits back on every charge. Check the station display for current pricing.</p>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p><a href="https://pathfinderrewards.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pathfinder Rewards</a> is a multi-network loyalty program for EV charging. Your membership works at ChargeVia and partner networks. You get flat-rate pricing, earn credits back on every charge, and can use those credits anywhere Pathfinder is accepted.</p>

        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Yep. The Explorer tier costs you exactly nothing. No membership fee, no hidden charges. You just pay for electricity. Higher tiers (Voyager, Pioneer, Trailblazer) are earned by charging, not by paying more fees.</p>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Nope. Credits stick around forever as long as your account is active. No "use it or lose it" nonsense.</p>

        <button class="faq-question">
          <span>Do you convert old gas stations?</span>
          <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Yes, we do! Former gas stations are ideal ChargeVia locations - they have the right format, visibility, and community presence. We also build new stations from scratch. Either way, we're creating EV charging stations that follow the familiar gas station model. If you know of a site, <a href="/partners">get in touch</a>.</p>

        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Potentially! We're looking for sites with good visibility, highway access, and at least 0.5 acres. ChargeVia handles the infrastructure and operations; you host the location and share in the revenue. Visit our <a href="/partners">Partners page</a> to learn more.</p>
