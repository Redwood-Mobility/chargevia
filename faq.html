        <button class="faq-question">
          <span>What is ChargeVia?</span>
          <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>ChargeVia is the EV gas station. We're building fast charging stations that combine DC fast chargers with on-site convenience stores. Think of it like your favorite gas station, but for electric vehicles - fast charging, clean restrooms, real snacks, and in-and-out convenience.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">
          <span>How is ChargeVia different from other charging networks?</span>
          <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Most charging networks put chargers in parking lots or garages - functional, but not convenient. ChargeVia is built around the gas station format: multiple fast chargers, a full convenience store, clean restrooms, and covered bays. It's designed to be a quick pit stop, not just a place to plug in and wait.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">
          <span>Where are ChargeVia stations located?</span>
          <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>We're building stations now in cities and suburbs where EV drivers actually are - along commute routes, near shopping and dining, and accessible from major highways. Many of our locations are converted former gas stations. Check our <a href="/locations">Locations page</a> for updates and to join the waitlist for your area.</p>

      <!-- Convenience Store -->
      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; margin-top: 3rem;">Convenience Store</h3>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">
          <span>What's at the convenience store?</span>
          <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Every ChargeVia station includes an on-site convenience store with coffee, snacks, drinks, essentials, and clean restrooms. It's the "hospitality" half of our format - ChargeVia provides the charging, the convenience store provides everything else you need for a quick pit stop.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">
          <span>Do I have to buy anything at the store to use the chargers?</span>
          <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>No. The charging and convenience store are separate. You can charge without buying anything. But hey, we think you'll want to grab a coffee while you wait.</p>

      <!-- Charging -->
      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; margin-top: 3rem;">Charging</h3>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">
          <span>What vehicles can charge at ChargeVia?</span>
          <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>ChargeVia stations have CCS (Combined Charging System) connectors, which work with most electric vehicles including Tesla (with adapter), Rivian, Ford, Chevrolet, Hyundai, Kia, BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen, and others. If your EV has a CCS port, it'll work at ChargeVia.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">
          <span>How fast is ChargeVia charging?</span>
          <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Our chargers deliver 150-350kW DC fast charging. Actual charging speed depends on your vehicle's capabilities and battery state, but most EVs can add 100+ miles of range in about 15-20 minutes.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">
          <span>How do I pay for charging?</span>
          <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Three ways: (1) Pathfinder Rewards membership - tap your card or use the app for flat-rate pricing and credits back; (2) Credit/debit card - tap or insert any major card; (3) ChargeVia app - start and pay from your phone. No account required for credit card payments.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">
          <span>How much does it cost to charge?</span>
          <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Pricing varies by location but is always flat-rate - you pay the same per kWh regardless of time of day. Pathfinder Rewards members get the best rates plus credits back on every charge. Check the app or station display for current pricing.</p>

          <span>What is Pathfinder Rewards?</span>
          <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Pathfinder Rewards is a multi-network loyalty program for EV charging. Your membership works at ChargeVia and partner networks. You get flat-rate pricing, earn credits back on every charge, and can use those credits anywhere Pathfinder is accepted.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">

          <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Yes. The Explorer tier is completely free - no membership fee, no monthly charges. You just pay for the electricity you use. Higher tiers (Voyager, Pioneer, Trailblazer) are earned through charging volume, not purchased.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">
          <span>Do you buy or convert old gas stations?</span>
          <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Yes! Former gas stations are ideal ChargeVia locations - they have the right format, visibility, and community presence. We're actively looking for gas station sites to convert. If you own one or know of one, <a href="/partners">get in touch</a>.</p>

          <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Potentially! We're looking for sites with good visibility, highway access, and at least 0.5 acres. ChargeVia handles the infrastructure and operations; you host the location and share in the revenue. Visit our <a href="/partners">Partners page</a> to learn more.</p>
